                                                            1. Bash Scripting
                            Introduction

Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks and creating custom scripts in Linux environments. It allows you to combine various system commands and control the flow of execution using programming constructs.
Basic Syntax and Structure:

* Shebang line: The first line of a Bash script should be   #!/bin/bash   to specify the interpreter.
* Comments: Use   #   to add comments to your script.
* Variables: Declare variables using a dollar sign and a name, e.g.,   my_variable=value.
* Command execution: Use the backtick () or $() to execute commands within a script and capture their output.

Variables and Data Types:

* Strings: Store sequences of characters, e.g., name="Alice".
* Numbers: Store numerical values, e.g., age=30.
* Arrays: Store multiple values in a single variable, e.g., fruits=("apple" "banana" "orange").

Control Flow

* Conditional statements: 

o if-then-else: Execute code based on a condition.
o case: Match a value against multiple patterns.
* Loops: 
o for: Iterate over a list of values.
o while: Repeat code as long as a condition is true.
o until: Repeat code until a condition is true.

Input/Output

* Reading input: Use the read command to read user input.
* Writing output: Use the echo command to print text to the console.
* File I/O: Use redirection (>, >>, <) and piping (|) to handle file input and output.

Command-Line Arguments

* Accessing arguments: Use $1, $2, $3, etc., to access command-line arguments.
* Special variables: $@ and $* represent all arguments.

Advanced Topics

* Functions: Define reusable blocks of code.
* Regular expressions: Pattern matching for text manipulation.
* Debugging: Use set -x to enable tracing and set -e to stop execution on errors.

Example Scripts

1. Hello, World!
Bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"
Use code with caution.

2. Simple calculator
Bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter two numbers:"
read num1 num2

sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "Sum: $sum"

Use code with caution.

2. System Monitoring

Introduction

System monitoring is essential for understanding the performance and health of your system. It involves tracking various metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and network traffic.

Resource Monitoring

* CPU usage: Use top, htop, or mpstat to monitor CPU activity.
* Memory usage: Use free or top to check memory utilization.
* Disk I/O: Use iostat or df to monitor disk usage and performance.
* Network traffic: Use iftop or netstat to analyze network traffic.

Process Monitoring

* Listing processes: Use ps or top to list running processes.
* Killing processes: Use kill or pkill to terminate processes.

Log Analysis

* Viewing logs: Use tail, head, or less to examine log files.
* Filtering logs: Use grep or awk to search for specific patterns in logs.

Performance Tuning

* Identifying bottlenecks: Analyze resource usage and identify performance issues.
* Optimizing system settings: Adjust kernel parameters or system configurations.

Example Scripts

1. Check disk usage
Bash

#!/bin/bash

df -h

Use code with caution.

2. Monitor CPU usage
Bash

#!/bin/bash

top

Use code with caution.

3. System Security

Introduction

System security is crucial to protect your system from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. It involves implementing various measures to safeguard your data and resources.

User and Group Management

* Creating users: Use useradd to create new users.
* Managing passwords: Use passwd to change passwords.
* Creating groups: Use groupadd to create new groups.
* Assigning permissions: Use usermod and groups to assign users to groups.

File and Directory Permissions

* Understanding permissions: Each file and directory has read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.
* Changing permissions: Use chmod to modify permissions.
* Changing ownership: Use chown to change the owner of a file or directory.

Firewall Configuration

* Using iptables: Configure firewall rules using iptables.
* Allowing traffic: Use iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -j ACCEPT to allow incoming TCP traffic.
* Denying traffic: Use iptables -A INPUT -j DROP to deny all incoming traffic.

Example Scripts

1. Create a new user
Bash

#!/bin/bash

useradd newuser

Use code with caution.

2. Change file permissions
Bash

#!/bin/bash

chmod 755 myfile
Use code with caution.
